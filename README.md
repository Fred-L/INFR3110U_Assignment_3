# EnginesGame Lab 4

This is based on the game i used for assignment 1 and the practical midterm. 
An observer pattern is used to call sound effects by my bulletholder object. The player object calls it to fire and it manipulates the pool of 10 bullets and plays a sound.
A singleton pattern is used as I made a singleton script called global variables that holds the players health.
Also, the shooting sound is just my voice pitch shifted.

The executable is located in the build folder

Our game is a simple arcade shooter where your goal is to survive as long as possible against the enemies spread around the map. When F9 is pressed you enter edit mode, with O and P you can switch between objects to place in the world and R is used to rotate them, pressing ENTER confirms the placement of the object and using COMMA you can undo and with PERIOD you can redo.

Building on what Sam, Joseph and I had from before. I attempted to add Object Pooling into the enemies spawning.
